### 3-Challenges 

Some of the challenges encountered building this project was working with MySQL. instead of using schemas
and seeds i went the hard way and use a list of dummy data created in excel to populate the table in my 
database. I kept getting depricated error wneh
i run the app because it was trying to take action before recieving data from the database and that's when 
i figured me and callbacks could be bests of friends. I struggled with getting live updates from my database like update as the action is happening 
and with also incorporate the third part of the App which the Supervisor view.

### 4-Future Updates

As future development i would like to incorporate a Supervisor View that oversees both Customer
and Manager View. It would
- Give access to all departments
- create new Departments
- Being able to view business progress and growth like How much money invested, sold for, expenses and 
  benefits
- Also make the use of npm colors and npm CLI-table to beautify the terminal view.
